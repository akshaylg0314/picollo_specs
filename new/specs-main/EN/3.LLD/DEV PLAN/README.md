## Implementation Priorities

Implementation priorities for project development have been set as follows:

### High Priority
1. Core component basic functionality implementation (APIServer, ActionController, StateManager)
2. Common ETCD library optimization and expansion
3. FilterGateway basic scenario processing implementation
4. Basic container lifecycle management functionality

### Medium Priority
1. PolicyManager and MonitoringServer implementation
2. Advanced state management and error recovery functionality
3. NodeAgent and distributed monitoring system
4. SettingsService and management interfaces

### Low Priority
1. TIMPANI Scheduler and real-time performance optimization
2. PHAROS Networking and eBPF-based networking
3. Vehicle-specialized managers (DeviceManager, AudioManager, etc.)
4. Advanced cloud integration and OTA functionality

## Development Schedule Summary

| Period | Key Tasks |

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a roadmap for the successful implementation of the PICCOLO(PULLPIRI) project. Through phase-specific detailed plans and technical research items, systematic development will proceed, and the effectiveness of the plan should be maintained through regular review and updates.

This plan should be continuously modified and supplemented according to changes that occur during the project's progress, and the development team should check progress and make necessary adjustments through regular meetings.
